# dsa
A data-structures and algorithms library for node

## Overview
> "A data-structure a day keeps the mind atrophy away..." -- Some wise dude.

The primary motivation behind `dsa` is to keep myself sharp. Specifically, its
goal is to provide a "low stress" way to keep myself engaged with algorithmic
problem-solving. I, due to my limited imagination, could think of no better way
to do so than to implement a nice library of common and exotic data-structures
and algorithms.

The secondary motivation is to provide a useful and large library of structures
and algorithms to supplement existing libraries.
