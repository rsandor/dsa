# dsa
A data-structures and algorithms library for node

## Overview
The primary motivation behind `dsa` is to keep myself sharp. I could think of
no better way to do so than to implement a nice library of common and exotic
data-structures and algorithms.

The secondary motivation is to provide a useful and large library of structures
and algorithms to supplement existing libraries.

## Proposed Data-Structures

### Arrays

- [BitArray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array)
- [CircularBuffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
- [GapBuffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer)

### Lists

- [LinkedList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
